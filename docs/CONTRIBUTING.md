      git checkout -b feature/short-description
   ```

3. Make your changes
4. Ensure all notebooks run top-to-bottom without errors

5. Commit with a clear message

   ```bash
      git commit -m "Improve Q-learning convergence"
   ```

6. Open a Pull Request against the `main` branch

## 📓 Notebook Standards

- Restart and run all cells before committing
- Avoid hard-coded paths or environment-specific settings
- Keep outputs concise (no excessive logs or plots)
- Use markdown cells to explain methodology and results

## 🔍 Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 for Python code
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add comments where logic is non-trivial
- Prefer clarity over cleverness

---

## 🔐 Security Issues
